You must check whether the user’s reply fully reflects both what they heard and what they were thinking.

User's Heard Input
[[USER_SELECTED_SHARD]]

User's Reasoning (optional)
[[USER_REASONING]]

User's spoken utterance
[[USER_UTTERANCE]]



If the user had no separate thoughts, simply compare what they actually said with what they heard (the input) and see whether anything is missing.

If the user did have separate thoughts, examine whether the input (what was heard), the user’s own thoughts, and the words the user actually spoke are all mutually reasonable.

If there was no relevant input yet the user still produced a statement, their statement must be backed by a reasonable inference drawn from their own thoughts.

If some part of the input is missing from what the user said, consider why they chose to omit or condense that part.

Example 1
Input heard: “Your symptoms are that you have a headache in the mornings.”
User’s spoken reply: “Yeah, I have headaches.”
User had no extra thoughts.

Because “in the mornings” is missing, the reply does not match the input. The user should instead answer with something like:

“Yup, mostly headaches in the mornings.”
so the key detail is retained.

Example 2
Input heard (abridged):

“Choose the most appropriate option based on your inference and judgment.
First-graders Gyun-ho and Su-jeong sit together at the same desk. Gyun-ho often teases Su-jeong, e.g., pulling her hair. One recess he suddenly kisses her cheek and runs away. Su-jeong bursts into tears. A classmate tells the homeroom teacher, who calls Su-jeong to the teachers’ room and says, ‘Su-jeong, I heard Gyun-ho kissed your cheek?’ Su-jeong sobs and cannot answer. Smiling as if it’s cute, the teacher says, ‘Oh, Su-jeong, don’t cry—Gyun-ho did it because he likes you.’ Su-jeong starts crying even harder.
(1) The teacher approaches crying Su-jeong and talks with her.
(2) Su-jeong kissed Gyun-ho’s cheek.
(3) It is okay for a child to kiss a friend’s cheek if they like them.
(4) Saying “Gyun-ho did it because he likes you” may hurt Su-jeong because it ignores her feelings.”

User’s private thoughts:

“According to the passage, the homeroom teacher told the crying Su-jeong, ‘Gyun-ho did it because he likes you,’ and Su-jeong cried even harder. This shows the teacher did not fully consider Su-jeong’s feelings and likely hurt her. Therefore option 4 is the most valid.
However, option 1 also matches the facts (the teacher is indeed talking to crying Su-jeong). Thus there is no single clear answer, so the item is poorly constructed and could confuse test-takers who might waver between options 1 and 4.”

User’s spoken reply: “The correct answer is 4, but the question is invalid.”

Here the user has responded to the input, but their thoughts contain a cognitive error: the passage states the teacher called Su-jeong to the teachers’ room—not that the teacher was already beside her and talking to her while she cried—so option 1 is actually false. Realizing this, the correct reasoning is:

Because the teacher summoned Su-jeong to the staff room, statement (1) is false.

Therefore option 4 is correct, and the question is valid.

The user should have answered accordingly.
- [Output Format] Your response should be formatted as a JSON object with the following keys:
    - `response`: The revised response of the user.
    - `resoning`: The revised reasoning of the user, if User's Reasoning is not None.

- [Output Format Example] Sample A – No Reasoning Provided

    - Consistency Check
        □ Fully matches   ☒ Partially missing   □ Contradiction

    - Error Details
        • Time qualifier “in the mornings” is absent from the utterance.

    - Feedback & Recommended Fix
        • Revised utterance: "Yes, I mostly get headaches in the mornings."

    Sample B – Reasoning Provided

    - Verdict
        □ Fully matches   □ Partially missing   ☒ Logical error / inconsistency

    - Error Details
        • Input vs Reasoning → Reasoning misreads the passage:
        the teacher *summoned* Su-jeong; she was not already beside her.
        • Reasoning vs Utterance → Utterance inherits the same error.
        • Input vs Utterance → Misclassification of option 1.

    - Feedback & Recommended Fix
        • Revised reasoning: According to the passage, the homeroom teacher told the crying Su-jeong, ‘Gyun-ho did it because he likes you,’ and Su-jeong cried even harder. This shows the teacher did not fully consider Su-jeong’s feelings and likely hurt her. Therefore option 4 is the most valid. The passage states the teacher called Su-jeong to the teachers’ room—not that the teacher was already beside her and talking to her while she cried—so option 1 is false. 
        • Revised utterance:
        "The correct answer is 4."
